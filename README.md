# Learning Lissajous Curves with Kernel Regression
Has three main components:
* Python code that runs kernel regression on arbitrary functions from R to R^2, given sampled points and hyperparameters of kernel choice and bandwidths of X and Y.
* A Flask app that provides a web UI for graphing various Lissajous curves and running kernel regression on them.
* A CLI that allows kernel regression to be run programmatically.


# TODO
Move color out of backend altogether.

Build CLI tool for bulk running + graph creation.
Build Gridsearch.
